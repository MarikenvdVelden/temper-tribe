# Data
The following data files might be of interest:

* [Study 1](data/intermediate/w1.RData) First study conducted by [Catteneo Institute](https://www.cattaneo.org/) containing information on political attitudes and Covid-specific conspiracy beliefs.
* [Study 2](data/intermediate/w2.RData) Second study conducted by [Catteneo Institute](https://www.cattaneo.org/) and [KiesKompas](https://www.kieskompas.nl/en/) containing information on political attitudes, Generic Conspiracy Mentality and Covid-specific conspiracy beliefs.

See the scripts in [src/data-processing](src/data-processing/prep_data.md) for details on how these files were constructed.

# Results
* [Analysis](src/analysis/analyses.md) Demonstrates the analyses to test and visualise whether voters/supporters of populist parties and extremist parties will be more prone to conspiracy thinking than voters/supporters of system/mainstream parties (H1) and whether voters that see more distance between themselves and the incumbent government party/parties are more likely to believe in conspiracies than voters that position themselves closer to the incumbent(s) (H2).  The analyses rely upon respectively four and eight operationalizations of the core concepts in H1 and H2 using a multiverse approach.
